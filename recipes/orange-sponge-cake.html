    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Sponge cake</strong> is a light cake made with egg whites, flour and sugar, sometimes leavened with
        baking powder.
        Some sponge cakes do not contain egg yolks, like angel food cake, but most of them do. Sponge cakes, leavened
        with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain.The sponge cake is thought to be one
        of the first of the non-yeasted cakes, and the earliest attested sponge cake recipe in English is found in a
        book by the English poet Gervase Markham,<em>The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues
            Which
            Ought to Be in a Complete Woman</em>(1615). Still, the cake was much more like a cracker: thin and crispy.
        Sponge
        cakes became the cake recognized today when bakers started using beaten eggs as a rising agent in the mid-18th
        century. The Victorian creation of baking powder by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843 allowed the
        addition of butter to the traditional sponge recipe, resulting in the creation of the Victoria sponge. Cakes are
        available in millions of flavours and have many recipes as well. Sponge cakes have become snack cakes via the
        Twinkie.</p>
